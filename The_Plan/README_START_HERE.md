## 🎓 WHAT YOU'RE BUILDING

A **production-grade multi-agent operating system** that:

1. **Executes agents natively** (CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen, Semantic Kernel)
2. **Recovers automatically** (detects failures, suggests fixes, retries)
3. **Coordinates agents** (consensus, handoffs, state sync)
4. **Optimizes costs** (local LLM + fallback = 60% savings)
5. **Operates reliably** (99.9% uptime, full audit trail)

**Why customers will choose you:**
- ❌ CrewAI: "Build easily" (fails in production)
- ❌ LangGraph: "Orchestrate" (requires manual recovery)
- ✅ **Omium: "Run in production reliably"** (auto-recovery, intelligent, scales)
