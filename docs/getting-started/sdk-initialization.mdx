title: SDK Initialization
description: Initialize your local Omium environment with your API key
---

## Run the initialization command

```bash
omium init
```

## What happens during initialization

You'll be prompted to:

1. **Paste your API key**
   - Get it from [API Keys page](https://app.omium.ai/api-keys)
   - Format: `omium_xxxxx`

2. **Confirm your API URL**
   - Defaults to `https://api.omium.ai`
   - Press Enter to accept, or enter custom URL

## Configuration location

The configuration is saved to `~/.omium/config.json`:

```json
{
  "api_key": "omium_xxxxx",
  "api_url": "https://api.omium.ai"
}
```

## After initialization

After initialization, you can use `omium` commands without specifying API keys. The SDK automatically loads configuration from `~/.omium/config.json`.

## Verify configuration

```bash
# Check if config exists
cat ~/.omium/config.json

# Test connection
omium list
```

<Warning>
Keep your API key secure. Never commit `~/.omium/config.json` to version control.
</Warning>
