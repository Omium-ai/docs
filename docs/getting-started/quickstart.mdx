## Step 1: Initialize Omium

```bash
omium init
```

You'll be prompted to:
1. Paste your API key (get it from [API Keys page](https://app.omium.ai/api-keys))
2. Confirm your API URL (defaults to `https://api.omium.ai`)

## Step 2: Create a Workflow

```bash
omium init-workflow --type crewai --name my-first-workflow
```

This creates a `workflow.json` file that you can edit.

## Step 3: Run Your Workflow

```bash
omium run workflow.json
```

## Step 4: View Results

```bash
# List all executions
omium list

# View specific execution
omium show <execution-id>
```
