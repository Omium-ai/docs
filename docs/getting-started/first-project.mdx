title: First project and push
description: Create a project and push it to the Automations dashboard
---

Create a project with `omium.toml` and push it to the platform so it appears on the [Automations dashboard](https://app.omium.ai/automations).

---

## 1. Create a project

From your project directory (or an empty folder):

```bash
omium project init
```

Or with a name:

```bash
omium project init --name my-agent
```

This creates an `omium.toml` file and a `workflows/` directory.

---

## 2. Edit omium.toml (optional)

Open `omium.toml` and set at least:

- `[project]` — `name` and `version`
- `[execution]` — `api_url` (default is `https://api.omium.ai/api/v1`)

See [Configuration: omium.toml](/configuration/omium-toml) for the full reference.

---

## 3. Push the project

```bash
omium project push
```

The CLI syncs your project and workflows to the Omium API. If the project has no workflow definitions, a default workflow is created so the project still appears on the dashboard.

---

## 4. View on the Automations dashboard

1. Open [app.omium.ai/automations](https://app.omium.ai/automations).
2. You should see a card for your project.
3. From there you can see runs, success rate, and cost.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **502 or connection errors:** Set the correct API URL: `omium configure --api-url https://api.omium.ai`
- **Project not visible:** Ensure `omium project push` completed successfully.
