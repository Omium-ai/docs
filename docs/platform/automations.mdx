title: Automations dashboard
description: Projects, workflows, runs, and cost
---

The **Automations** page at [app.omium.ai/automations](https://app.omium.ai/automations) shows your projects and workflows, run history, success rate, and cost.

---

## What you see

- **Project cards** — One card per project (or workflow). Each shows name, status (e.g. Healthy, Idle, Failed), total runs, success rate, cost, and last run time.
- **Summary metrics** — Total automations, healthy count, live runs, total cost.

---

## How projects appear

Projects appear when you **push** them from your machine:

1. Create a project: `omium project init` and add an `omium.toml` (see [First project and push](/getting-started/first-project)).
2. Run `omium project push`.
3. The CLI syncs your project and workflows to the Omium API. If there are no workflow definitions, a default workflow is still created so the project shows as one card.
4. Refresh the Automations page; your project card should appear.

If a project does not appear, check that `omium project push` completed without errors and that you use the same account as the API key.
