## Overview

The Omium Python SDK allows you to programmatically interact with the Omium platform, enabling you to:
- Execute workflows
- Create checkpoints for fault tolerance
- Manage workflow state and recovery
- Integrate with popular agent frameworks

## Installation

First, ensure you have installed the Omium SDK:

```bash
pip install omium
```

## Initialization

After running `omium init` in your terminal, the SDK automatically uses your saved configuration (`~/.omium/config.json`):

```python
from omium import OmiumClient

# SDK automatically loads config from ~/.omium/config.json
client = OmiumClient()

# Or specify API key explicitly
# client = OmiumClient(api_key="omium_xxxxx", api_url="https://api.omium.ai")
```

## Key Features

### Execute Workflows

```python
from omium import OmiumClient

client = OmiumClient()

async def run_my_workflow(workflow_id: str, input_data: dict):
    execution = await client.execute_workflow(
        workflow_id=workflow_id,
        input_data=input_data
    )
    print(f"Started execution: {execution.id} with status {execution.status}")
    return execution
```

### Checkpointing Decorator

Use the `@client.checkpoint` decorator to automatically create checkpoints for your functions. This is crucial for fault tolerance and recovery.

```python
from omium import OmiumClient

client = OmiumClient()

@client.checkpoint(name="data_processed_step")
def process_data(data: dict):
    print(f"Processing data: {data}")
    # Simulate some work
    processed_result = {"processed_data": data["value"] * 2}
    return processed_result

@client.checkpoint(name="analysis_step")
def analyze_result(result: dict):
    print(f"Analyzing result: {result}")
    # Simulate more work
    analysis_output = {"analysis": f"Result is {result['processed_data']}"}
    return analysis_output

async def run_pipeline():
    initial_data = {"value": 10}
    processed = await process_data(initial_data)
    analysis = await analyze_result(processed)
    print(f"Final analysis: {analysis}")

# Example usage (assuming an event loop is running)
# import asyncio
# asyncio.run(run_pipeline())
```

### Manual Checkpoints

You can also create checkpoints manually:

```python
from omium import OmiumClient

client = OmiumClient()

async def manual_checkpoint_example(execution_id: str, current_state: dict):
    checkpoint = await client.create_checkpoint(
        execution_id=execution_id,
        name="manual_save_point",
        state=current_state,
        metadata={"user_note": "Saved before critical operation"}
    )
    print(f"Manual checkpoint created: {checkpoint.id}")
    return checkpoint
```

### Replay and Rollback

The SDK also provides methods to replay or rollback executions:

```python
from omium import OmiumClient

client = OmiumClient()

async def manage_execution_recovery(execution_id: str, checkpoint_id: str):
    # Replay from a specific checkpoint
    replay_response = await client.replay_execution(
        execution_id=execution_id,
        checkpoint_id=checkpoint_id
    )
    print(f"Replay status: {replay_response.status}")

    # Rollback to a specific checkpoint
    rollback_response = await client.rollback_execution(
        execution_id=execution_id,
        checkpoint_id=checkpoint_id
    )
    print(f"Rollback status: {rollback_response.status}")
```

## Error Handling

The SDK raises exceptions for API errors. Implement `try-except` blocks to handle them gracefully.

```python
from omium import OmiumClient
from omium.exceptions import OmiumAPIError

client = OmiumClient()

async def safe_api_call():
    try:
        # Example: trying to get a non-existent workflow
        workflow = await client.get_workflow(workflow_id="non_existent_id")
        print(workflow)
    except OmiumAPIError as e:
        print(f"API Error: {e.status_code} - {e.detail}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```
