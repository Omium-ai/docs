## Use Omium with LangGraph

Integrate LangGraph workflows with Omium for automatic checkpointing and failure recovery:

### Option 1: SDK Integration

```python
from omium import OmiumClient
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph

client = OmiumClient()

# Your LangGraph workflow
# Assuming WorkflowState, process_node, respond_node are defined
class WorkflowState:
    # Define your state here
    pass

def process_node(state):
    print("Processing...")
    return {"output": "processed"}

def respond_node(state):
    print("Responding...")
    return {"output": "responded"}

graph = StateGraph(WorkflowState)
graph.add_node("process", process_node)
graph.add_node("respond", respond_node)
graph.add_edge("process", "respond")
compiled = graph.compile()

# Wrap with Omium
@client.checkpoint(name="langgraph_execution")
def run_langgraph(state):
    return compiled.invoke(state)

# Execute with Omium reliability layer
# result = run_langgraph(initial_state) # initial_state needs to be defined
```

### Option 2: Export LangGraph Workflow to Omium

Export your LangGraph compiled graph to import into Omium:

```bash
omium export-langgraph my_graph.py:compiled_graph -o workflow.json
```

**Example: `my_graph.py`**
```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph

# Assuming WorkflowState, process_node, respond_node are defined
class WorkflowState:
    # Define your state here
    pass

def process_node(state):
    print("Processing...")
    return {"output": "processed"}

def respond_node(state):
    print("Responding...")
    return {"output": "responded"}

graph = StateGraph(WorkflowState)
graph.add_node("process", process_node)
graph.add_node("respond", respond_node)
graph.add_edge("process", "respond")

compiled_graph = graph.compile()
```
Then export:
```bash
omium export-langgraph my_graph.py:compiled_graph -o my_workflow.json
```

Import the JSON in [Automation page](https://app.omium.ai/automation) to:
- Visualize the graph structure
- Edit workflow configuration
- Control retries and timeouts per node
- Execute via Omium execution engine
