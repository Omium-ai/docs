## Use Omium with CrewAI

Omium provides two ways to integrate with CrewAI:

1. **SDK-only integration**: Wrap your existing CrewAI code with Omium primitives for checkpointing and failure handling.
2. **Workflow import**: Export your CrewAI workflow definition and import it into Omium's Automation page for full UI management.

### Option 1: SDK Integration (Quick Start)

```python
from omium import OmiumClient
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

client = OmiumClient()

@client.checkpoint(name="crew_execution")
def run_crew_workflow():
    researcher = Agent(
        role='Researcher',
        goal='Research the topic',
        backstory='You are a research expert'
    )
    
    task = Task(
        description='Research the topic',
        agent=researcher
    )
    
    crew = Crew(agents=[researcher], tasks=[task])
    return crew.kickoff()

# Run with Omium checkpointing and failure handling
result = run_crew_workflow()
```

### Option 2: Export CrewAI Workflow to Omium

Export your CrewAI workflow definition to import into Omium's Automation page:

```bash
omium export-crew my_crew.py:my_crew_instance -o workflow.json
```

This creates a JSON file that you can:
1. Import in the [Automation page](https://app.omium.ai/automation) (click "Import from JSON")
2. Edit and manage in Omium UI
3. Execute via Omium for reliability and monitoring

**Example: `my_crew.py`**
```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

researcher = Agent(
    role='Researcher',
    goal='Research the topic',
    backstory='You are a research expert'
)

task = Task(
    description='Research the topic',
    agent=researcher
)

my_crew_instance = Crew(agents=[researcher], tasks=[task])
```
Then export:
```bash
omium export-crew my_crew.py:my_crew_instance -o my_workflow.json
```
