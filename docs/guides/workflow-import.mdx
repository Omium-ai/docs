## Import Workflows into Omium

After exporting workflows from your preferred framework (e.g., CrewAI, LangGraph), you can import them into Omium for centralized management, execution, and monitoring.

### Steps to Import:

1. **Go to the [Automation page](https://app.omium.ai/automation)** in your Omium dashboard.
2. **Click the "Import from JSON" button**.
3. **Upload or paste the exported JSON file** containing your workflow definition.
4. **Omium will create a new workflow** that you can then edit, manage, and execute.

### Benefits of Importing:

- **Centralized Management**: View and manage all your workflows in one place.
- **Visual Editor**: Edit workflow configurations and parameters through an intuitive UI.
- **Reliable Execution**: Leverage Omium's automatic checkpointing and failure handling.
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Track execution status, view logs, and analyze performance.
- **Version Control**: Omium helps manage versions of your workflows.

## Example Workflow JSON

A typical imported workflow JSON might look like this (simplified):

```json
{
  "name": "My Research Crew",
  "description": "A CrewAI workflow to research a given topic.",
  "workflow_type": "crewai",
  "definition": {
    "agents": [
      {
        "role": "Researcher",
        "goal": "Find relevant information",
        "backstory": "An expert in data retrieval"
      }
    ],
    "tasks": [
      {
        "description": "Search for latest AI trends",
        "agent_index": 0
      }
    ]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "tags": ["research", "ai"]
  }
}
```
